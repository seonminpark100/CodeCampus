                        TypeScript is a strict superset
                        of JavaScript, which means anything
                        that is implemented in JavaScript 
                        can be implemented using TypeScript
                        along with the choice of adding 
                        enhanced features. It is an Open Source
                        Object Oriented programming language and
                        strongly typed language. As TS code is 
                        converted to JS code it makes it easier 
                        to integrate into JavaScript projects. 
                        The TypeScript Tutorial provides the 
                        complete guide from beginner to 
                        advanced level.
